RECOMMENDATION

Sales Rep

I recommend that the top sales rep David be awarded best sales rep for the year and he should be encouraged to train other sales reps to ensure great sales in the coming year. Charlie should be made to go for more training for his low sales turn out.

Payment Method

I recommend the most widely used mode of payment credit card should be encouraged as it brings about more revenue.

Sales By Region

I recommend that the measures taken in the north to ensure great sales should be enacted in the south with low sales and that the sales rep for the north responsible for the  sales be taken to the south to ensure that the measures are properly enacted in the coming year.

Product Category

I recommend that clothing which sold very well for the year be looked into and ensure it doesn't deplete and always in stock. Food which had low sales be looked into, to ensure that the reason they don't sell is spoilage.

CONCLUSION

Sales performance shows that a few top sales reps are driving most of the revenue. Over time, sales peaked early in the year but dipped before picking up again. Clothing, furniture, and electronics are the best-selling product categories. The northern region leads in sales, but other regions are not far behind. Customers prefer credit cards and bank transfers over cash. Returning customers slightly outspend new ones, indicating good retention. Discounts between 20-30% seem to generate the highest sales, showing that strategic discounting works. Overall, focusing on top products, optimizing regional strategies, and leveraging targeted discounts could boost revenue further.
